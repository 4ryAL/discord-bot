- `discord.py` version 2.x installed

### 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
💡 If requirements.txt is missing, install manually:

pip install discord.py
🔑 Bot Token
In bot.py, replace "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" with your actual bot token:

python

bot.run("YOUR_TOKEN_HERE")
Make sure you never share your token publicly.

🕹️ How to Use
Once the bot is set up:

bash

python bot.py
Then, on your server, type /rps and make your choice: rock, paper, or scissors.

🛡️ Don't forget to enable Privileged Gateway Intents in your Discord Developer Portal!
